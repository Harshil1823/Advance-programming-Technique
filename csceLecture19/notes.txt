Polymorphism - takes multiple forms - changes based on situation

Virtual functions - our means of creating Polymorphism with our functions 
                    in c++ 

redefined functions: functions calls are bound at compile time based on the way the pointer 
                     on the left was declared 
Virtual functions: function calls bounds at run time based on the type of 
                    object the pointer points at the time
