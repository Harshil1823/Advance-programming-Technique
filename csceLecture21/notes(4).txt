Template = pattern for a function or class

overloading a function - the programmer implements multiple versions of the
function that work for different types or different numbers of parameters. 
Benefit is to the user of the function in that the user doesn't have to remember a bunch of different function names.

IF the implementation of a function is independent of the types of the arguments,
we can use a template for the type and allow the compiler/linker to create the 
versions needed (overload as necessary for us without us having to write the
same implementation a bunch of times).
